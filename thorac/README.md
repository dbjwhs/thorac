## Opening Prophecy

```
Can we bring this to the gods—
make us new beyond the laws?
Without the laws we cannot remain.
With the laws we stay the same.
We know that stone cannot heal.
Once etched, the words are real.
With these wounds we create time
for all to heal.
With this change, love is made—
together, a world remade.
Fire can change the stone
from what it was,
reborn as something new to us.
```

## The Raid

The blade of his grandsire had never sung so sweet in Thorac's iron grip. Forged in the ancient fires and quenched in the blood of kings, it had drunk deep of enemy life for three generations. When he had emerged first from the U Tar Uboc—the Trial of Manhood—last summer under the crimson moon, old Orthox had waited with the ancestral steel gleaming in his weathered hands. The former Ubarac's eyes had blazed with fierce pride as he passed the weapon to his grandson, for in that moment, Thorac had become Utorac—a warrior of the clan.

These memories flickered through his mind like flame-shadows as death rushed toward him on five pairs of legs. The Thel warriors saw only his clan markings, read only the simple rank of Utorac, and grinned with wolf-like hunger. What was one against five? What hope had a single blade against their combined steel?

They could not know they faced the deadliest killer the savage Ubu had ever spawned—young Thorac, whose name would one day shake the very foundations of their world and usher in an age of blood and iron.
The Emorac raids always intensified during the Clamortic Moon Cycle, when the long nights approached and desperate clans rolled the bones of fate. In the harsh wastelands of Zulac, theft was a coward's game, but taking by strength—whether of arm or wit—was the natural law of survival.

The Thel had learned this truth when their great dam shattered like a giant's toy, drowning their crops in brown flood-water and toppling their sacred Almac—the House of Teaching. Ancient scrolls dissolved, carved stones cracked, and with them died the accumulated wisdom of generations. Now they faced the choice all desperate clans must face: raid or starve.
So the Thel elders had cast their lots and spoken their war-prayers. One great strike against the Ubu—swift, brutal, decisive. Success would mean survival for their children and glory-songs carved in stone for all the tribes to remember. Each warrior bore not just his weapons, but the weight of his people's fate and the hungry eyes of his kin.

The elders knew what the young bloods did not—that victory would birth legends, but defeat would birth only graves. They had walked through their ruined city, seen the hollow eyes of their women and the swollen bellies of starving children. The gods demanded sacrifice, and tonight, beneath alien stars, that debt would be paid in full.

Aye, there would be a poem stone carved this night—but not the one either clan expected, and written in blood darker than any scribe's ink.

## The Witness

```
She glimpsed his power—held her blade in check.
He saw her beauty—stayed his killing blow.
United, they crumbled into separate wrecks,
Divided, into deeper love they'd grow.

What law forbade, desire dared to make,
What duty killed, their hearts conspired to wake.
With the dangerous seed of change between them cast—
They planted futures that would break the past.
```

---

Marrka struck first, his war-cry splitting the twilight air—but the Utorac was already there, moving like shadow given flesh. Had the young Thel stumbled on some hidden root? Or had death itself reached out with invisible claws?
By Bel's black throne—Marrka crumpled without a sound, crimson spreading beneath him like spilled wine. The others barely had time to blink before steel sang its harvest song, and where five warriors had charged, only silence remained.

All save Arok.

He stood alone in that circle of the dead, close enough to see his own doom reflected in the Utorac's pitiless eyes. No fear touched his heart—fear was for lesser men. But hopelessness? Aye, that cold serpent coiled in his belly as he gazed upon his fallen sword-brothers. Some had died with prayers on their lips, others with curses, but all had died.

Arok felt his blade grow heavy as lead. His sword-arm trembled, began to fall—then stopped. He looked down in wonder. The Utorac's ancestral steel had caught his own blade, holding it suspended between earth and sky like some ritual offering.
When Arok raised his eyes, he saw eternity waiting.

His breath sighed out like wind through autumn leaves, and he sank down among his brothers. From somewhere beyond the veil, he heard the voices of his gods calling—ancient voices, patient and kind. Sleep came easy then, for in those divine eyes he glimpsed the peace that awaits all warriors when their last battle is done.

Thus passed Arok of the Thel, and with him died the hopes of his doomed clan.

## The Teaching of Time

```
Time holds us all—
but you can shorten its hold on you,
lengthen your hold on it.
The master knows:
it is not time that changes,
but the soul within.
Change the body,
change the mind.
Change the mind,
change the soul.
Change the soul,
and time becomes your servant.
It continues to turn,
but now it serves your will
```

## The Keeper's Proposal

Thorac stood among the fallen, his grandfather's blade still humming with the memory of swift death. The Clamortic moonlight painted the battlefield silver, and in that ethereal glow, he saw her. She emerged from behind the ancient standing stones that marked the boundary between Ubu and neutral lands—a figure that should not exist in this place of sudden violence.

She was Thel, he could tell by the braided copper wire wound through her dark hair and the geometric patterns etched into her leather armor. Yet she had not charged with her clan brothers. She had watched. Witnessed. And now she approached with neither weapon drawn nor fear in her stride.

"You fight like the old stories speak of the Ubumak," she said, her voice carrying the musical cadence of the teaching songs. "As if time bends around your blade."

Thorac's grip tightened on his sword, though something in her manner gave him pause. "You are Thel. Your brothers came to steal our harvest, our knowledge. Why do you not join them in death or flee to your broken dam?"

She stopped three paces away—close enough to speak without shouting, far enough that sudden movement would be seen. "Because I have seen what the teaching stones prophesy. Because sometimes witnessing is more important than acting."

The wind shifted, carrying with it the scent of distant rain and the metallic tang of spilled blood. Above them, the Clamortic moon reached its apex, and Thorac felt the familiar stirring that came when the gods paid attention to mortal affairs.

"Speak your name, daughter of Thel, before I decide whether you join your kinsmen or walk away into the night."

"I am Syalla of the Thel, keeper of our remaining teaching stones, and I have come not to raid but to offer a different path." She gestured to the fallen warriors. "This raid was born of desperation, not malice. My people starve not from laziness but from calamity. Your blade has proven we chose poorly."

---

## The Prophecy Revealed

```
Blood calls to blood across the years
Stone calls to stone across the void
What was broken seeks to mend
What was sundered seeks to join
In the space between the clans
New laws are born from old demands
The witness and the warrior stand
Where fate writes with mortal hands
```
---

Thorac had expected many things when he set out to patrol the borderlands that night, but a Thel keeper offering parlance was not among them. Keepers were sacred among all the clans—they who memorized the teaching stones and carried the accumulated wisdom of their people. To harm one brought the wrath of not just their clan, but of the gods themselves.

"You risk much coming here alone, Keeper. Your clan raids us, and I have answered with steel. The law of the borderlands is clear."

Syalla nodded slowly, her eyes never leaving his. "The law is clear, but the law is also incomplete. The teaching stones speak of times when the old ways must give birth to new ones. When calamity strikes, sometimes survival requires more than might or cleverness. Sometimes it requires wisdom."

She reached into her traveling pouch, moving slowly so he could see she drew no weapon. Instead, she produced a small stone tablet, its surface covered with the intricate markings that denoted a teaching stone of high order.

"This was carved three generations ago by my grandmother's grandmother. She foresaw a time when the Clamortic Moon would witness not just raids and death, but the birth of something new. A joining that would strengthen both clans and herald changes across all of Zulac."

Thorac studied the tablet from where he stood, his warrior's training warring with his curiosity. Orthox had taught him that wisdom came not just from the sword, but from knowing when not to draw it.

"Read it aloud, Keeper. Let the moon and the dead witness your words."

Syalla lifted the stone and began to recite, her voice taking on the formal cadence of the teaching songs:

"When the children of different stones meet at the borderland of their fathers' choosing, when blood has been spilled but wisdom prevails, then shall the clans find strength not in separation but in the joining of their knowledge. The harvest of one shall feed both, the wisdom of both shall guide all, and from their union shall come warriors whose deeds will echo across the ages."

The words hung in the night air like a challenge to the very foundations of their world. Thorac felt the weight of destiny settling around him like a cloak, heavy with possibility and peril.

## Ancient Words

```
Ancient words on newer stones
Prophecy and present meet
What the elders carved in hope
Young hearts now must complete
At the crossing of the paths
Where old grudges die
New stories are born beneath
The eternal sky
```

---

"Your words are pretty, Keeper, and your stone speaks of grand futures. But I see five dead warriors at my feet and hear their clan's children crying hunger in the distance. How does your prophecy answer for their blood?"

Syalla knelt beside the nearest fallen warrior—young Marrka, who had been first to die and perhaps had been the bravest of them all. She placed her hand on his still chest and spoke words in the old tongue, the language reserved for speaking with the dead.

"Their blood was not spilled in vain if it waters the ground where understanding grows," she said, rising. "I propose something that has not been tried since the first clans carved their boundaries in stone. A joining of our peoples, not through conquest but through choice. Your harvest shared with our need, our remaining teaching stones shared with your wisdom. A new clan born from the ashes of old conflicts."

Thorac laughed, but there was no mirth in it. "You speak impossibilities, Keeper. The Ubu and Thel have raided each other since the first stones were carved. We are like fire and water—we cannot exist in the same space without one destroying the other."

"And yet," Syalla said, stepping closer, "fire can heat water without destroying it. Water can cool fire without extinguishing it. Perhaps it is time to discover what we might become together rather than what we have always been apart."

The Clamortic moon began its descent toward the horizon, and with it, Thorac felt the moment of decision approaching like a storm front. Soon, scouts from both clans would come looking for their missing members. Soon, the night's events would demand an accounting that could either end in greater bloodshed or... something else entirely.

He looked at the teaching stone in Syalla's hands, then at the faces of the dead warriors, then finally into her eyes, which held depths he had not expected to find in an enemy.

"If I were to entertain this madness," he said slowly, "what would you propose we do with the dead? How do we explain to our clans that their warriors died not for raid or defense, but for the birth of something that has no name?"

Syalla smiled for the first time since she had appeared, and in that smile, Thorac saw not the enemy he had expected, but the possibility of an ally he had never imagined.

## The Forbidden Birth

"There is something you should know," he said quietly, the weight of old secrets heavy in his voice. "Something that may change how you view this joining you propose."

The keeper tilted her head, sensing the shift in his tone. "Speak, Thorac of the Ubu. The moon witnesses all truths tonight."

He looked down at his grandfather's blade, remembering the day Orthox had placed it in his hands, remembering the stories that had been whispered but never fully told. The Clamortic Moon seemed to pulse above them, as if the very cosmos demanded this revelation.

"I was born during the Clamortic Moon Cycle," he said simply, and watched as understanding dawned in Syalla's eyes.

---

## The Child Who Should Not Be

```
Forbidden birth beneath cursed moon
A child who should not be
Yet walks among the living still
Defying destiny
What laws were broken for his breath?
What love paid such a price?
The answer lies in shadows deep
Where sacrifice meets sacrifice
```

---

"Impossible," Syalla breathed, though even as she spoke the word, she knew it was not. Her keeper's training had taught her to read the signs that others missed, and now she saw them clearly in Thorac's bearing, in the way the moonlight seemed to cling to him, in the otherworldly grace with which he had moved in battle.

"My mother was Essa of the Thel," Thorac continued, and Syalla's sharp intake of breath told him she knew the name. "She was gifted with deep wisdom and understanding of the laws. She knew what my birth would mean, knew the price that would be demanded."

He began to pace, his grandfather's blade still in his hand, catching the silver light. "The law was clear—I should have been cast into the Well of Sorrows. But my father, the Ubarac who should have enforced that law, could not bear to destroy what he and my mother had created."

Syalla found herself stepping closer, drawn by the power of this impossible tale. "Essa of the Thel was legendary among our people for her wisdom. But she died during that same Clamortic Cycle, and her child..." She paused, the implications crashing over her like a wave. "Her child was said to have been lost to the laws."

"Lost, but not destroyed," Thorac said grimly. "My father chose exile over infanticide. He fled with me in the night, abandoning his position, his clan, his honor. And my mother..." His voice caught slightly. "She chose her own path to the gods rather than live with the consequences of what we had brought upon our peoples."

The keeper of the Thel felt the ancient stones in her memory shifting, rearranging themselves into new patterns of understanding. "And Orthox raised you?"

"My grandfather understood that some laws serve life, and others serve only tradition. He saw in my survival not an affront to the gods, but a sign that perhaps the old ways needed examining." Thorac stopped pacing and faced her directly. "He trained me not just to be a warrior, but to be someone who could look beyond the boundaries our fathers carved in stone."

---

## The Bridge Between Worlds

```
The sins of fathers become the strength of sons
What was forbidden becomes the foundation
In the child of two peoples
Lives the hope of both
Born in defiance of ancient law
Raised in wisdom of new possibility
The bridge between worlds
Stands ready to be crossed
```

---

Syalla stared at him with new eyes, seeing not just the warrior who had slain her kinsmen, but the living embodiment of everything her prophecy stones had foretold. "You carry the blood of both our clans," she whispered. "Ubu strength and Thel wisdom, forged in the fire of forbidden love."

"And you wonder why your raid tonight felt like destiny rather than chance," Thorac replied. "I have spent my life knowing that I should not exist, yet here I stand. Perhaps it is time to stop apologizing for surviving and start understanding why the gods allowed it."

The dead warriors lay between them, but now their sacrifice seemed less like waste and more like the price of transformation. Syalla knelt again beside young Marrka, but this time her words were different.

"Your blood waters the ground where a new tree will grow," she said softly. "One with roots in both our soils, branches reaching toward a sky we have never dared to imagine."

She rose and looked at Thorac with growing certainty. "The teaching stones speak of a time when the children of different clans would meet at the borderlands. But they never said it would be one child, carrying both bloodlines in his veins."

"My mother left a sealed scroll when she died," Thorac said slowly, pieces of a larger puzzle beginning to fit together. "Orthox has never opened it, waiting for what he calls 'the proper moment.' Perhaps..."

"Perhaps that moment is now," Syalla finished. "When her son stands where she envisioned, facing the choice between perpetuating the old cycles or forging something entirely new."

The Clamortic Moon continued its descent, but neither of them felt the pressure of time as they had before. Instead, there was a sense of inevitability, as if all the years of exile, training, and preparation had led to this single conversation in a field strewn with the dead.

"If we do this," Thorac said carefully, "if we attempt this joining you propose, it will not be a simple matter of sharing resources. The revelation of my parentage alone could tear both clans apart. Some will see it as vindication of an ancient prophecy. Others will see it as proof that the laws exist for good reason."

Syalla nodded gravely. "And yet, what is the alternative? Your existence proves that life finds a way beyond the confines of law. Perhaps it is time our peoples did the same."

She reached into her traveling pouch again and withdrew another stone, this one older and more worn than the first. "This belonged to Essa herself. It was returned to us after her death, though we never knew why she had carried it or what it meant."

Thorac took the stone with reverent hands, feeling the weight of his mother's touch still lingering in its carved surface. The markings were unlike any he had seen before—part Thel, part Ubu, but something more as well.

---

## Essa's Final Words

```
She who saw beyond the veil of time
Carved these words with dying breath:
Laws that serve death over life
Are laws that deserve to die
In the joining of what was separate
In the healing of what was broken
The future writes itself in stone
With love as its chisel
```

---

The words seemed to burn themselves into Thorac's mind as he read them by moonlight. Here was his mother's final gift—not just her blessing for what he might become, but her challenge to make her sacrifice meaningful.

"She knew," he said quietly. "Somehow, she knew this night would come."

"The question now," Syalla said, "is whether we dare to honor her vision or the wisdom to know if we should."

## The Recognition

But even as Thorac held his mother's final stone, another memory stirred—one more recent, yet no less significant. The morning when he had awakened to find Em speaking tensely with the Thel woman who was to be returned to her clan. The morning when he had looked upon a face that called to something profound in his blood.

"There is something else," he said slowly, his mind racing through connections he had not understood until now. "A few days ago, there was a Thel woman at our holding. Isa, daughter of Exle the law-giver. She spoke of her brother Arok, who died by my blade in an earlier skirmish."

Syalla's eyes widened. "Isa is my cousin, though we were raised apart. But why do you speak of her now?"

Thorac felt the weight of revelation settling upon him like a mantle. "Because when I looked upon her, I felt what I had never felt before. A recognition that went deeper than sight or sound. And when she spoke her mother's name—Exle—I remembered my grandfather's rage at hearing it, though I was too young then to understand."

The keeper's sharp mind began working through the implications. Exle was one of the law-givers who ruled on Clamortic births. She would have been involved in any decision about..." She paused, the terrible possibility dawning on her.

"About what to do with a forbidden child," Thorac finished grimly. "But what if her involvement was more than professional? What if the law-giver herself broke the very laws she enforced?"

---

## Hidden Truths

```
Blood calls to blood across the years
Though scattered by law and fear
In the children of different mothers
Lives the truth of hidden brothers
What was severed by decree
Seeks reunion destiny
The sins of fathers, mothers too
Find redemption in what their children do
```

---

Syalla stared at him with growing amazement. "You think Isa is your half-sister? That your father and Exle..."

"I think my father's exile was longer and more complex than the stories tell," Thorac said. "And I think the anger between our clans runs deeper than territorial disputes. It runs through bloodlines that were severed by law and shame."

The implications crashed over both of them like a tide. If Thorac was right, then the joining of their clans was not just politically necessary—it was a family reunion long overdue. The very laws that had torn their families apart could be healed through their unity.

"We must bring this to Orthox," Syalla said urgently. "And to Isa. If she is indeed your sister, then she has a right to know. And more than that—she could be the key to convincing both our peoples that this union is not just possible, but destined."

Thorac nodded slowly, feeling the threads of fate weaving themselves into patterns he was only beginning to understand. "But first, we must deal with what lies before us. These dead warriors need explanation, and both our clans will be looking for answers come dawn."

He looked at the fallen Thel raiders, then at Syalla, then at his mother's stone still glowing faintly in the moonlight. "Perhaps it is time to stop hiding from the truth of what we are and start embracing what we could become."

The Clamortic Moon had nearly set, but neither felt the urgency of its passing anymore. Instead, they felt the slow, inexorable pull of destiny finally asserting itself after years of being denied.

"When I saw Isa," Thorac continued quietly, "I felt something I had never experienced—the presence of family I didn't know existed. If she is my sister, then she has lived her entire life among the Thel, believing herself fully one of them, while I lived among the Ubu, believing the same of myself."

"And now you both discover you are children of two worlds," Syalla said softly. "Living bridges between peoples who have forgotten they were once one."

The wind shifted again, carrying with it the scent of approaching dawn and the weight of changes that could no longer be avoided.

## They Sing for Their Dead

The battle had been no battle at all—merely the brief, brutal education of fools. Five Thel warriors lay sprawled in crimson ruin, and Arok the Terrible among them, he whose name was whispered with dread even in the halls of mighty Ubu. Yet they had fallen like wheat before the scythe, children fumbling with wooden toys while death danced among them with steel and sinew.

Magoroc watched from the shadows, his scarred hands unconsciously flexing. By God's iron bones, he had seen slaughter aplenty in his years, but this—this was artistry written in blood. Thorac's blade had flowed like quicksilver, each stroke inevitable as winter's coming. Even now, warriors muttered in hushed tones, questioning what sorcery they had witnessed. Could mortal flesh move with such deadly grace?

The Ubarac studied Thorac with the cold eye of a veteran wolf measuring a rival. Not tall like his grandsire, but built lean and hard as Thocian steel. Dark hair fell to his shoulders, and beneath bronze skin, muscles coiled with each step like serpents beneath silk. He bore his weapons in the ancient manner—sword angled across his broad back, dagger riding high on the baldric. The old ways, Magoroc thought with grim approval. His grandfather's stubborn ways still walked in this one's shadow.

Their greeting held no ceremony of rank or station—only the fierce embrace of kinsmen who had bled together under alien stars. Magoroc's battle-scarred hand gripped the younger man's sword-arm, the ritual touch that said: You are mine, and I am yours, and death shall find no purchase between us.

When the death-rites began, even these sons of slaughter fell silent. The western sun bled crimson across the sky while twin moons rose like watching eyes. The slain lay in ordered rows, faces turned toward the dying light, weapons naked in their lifeless hands. Then came the torch, and flame leaped hungrily skyward as voices rose in the ancient death-song—a barbaric hymn that spoke of glory undying and names carved forever in the stones of time.

```
I will remember...

The reek of burning flesh and splintered bone,
Brother, father, son—now ash alone.
Born in blood beneath a crimson sky,
For clan and steel you chose to die.

We stand like granite in the flame,
And thunder forth your deathless name.
No more your war-cry splits the air,
No more your laughter echoes there.

No more your iron grip in mine,
Lost where battle-ravens dine.
Your blade sang hymns to crimson gods,
While death stalked grim across the sods.

Now cold and still, your fighting done,
Beneath the dying, bloody sun.
Let flame devour what flesh remains—
Your spirit rides the astral planes.

I'll not forget how steel rang true,
Nor honor those your death-song slew.
Though Hel's black gates have claimed your soul,
Your name lives on—fierce, proud, and whole.

I will remember...
```

## The Morning Encounter

Thorac woke to the hushed breath of pre-dawn, when night's black wings still folded over the world. His grandfather's iron discipline held him motionless—eyes sealed, senses reaching like hungry wolves into the darkness. "Show them you wake, boy, and you show them where death sleeps," the old Ubarac had growled during those brutal training years.

The air carried that wine-sweet taste that comes before first light, when shadows grow long and the boundary between worlds grows thin. In this sacred hour, a man could hear the very heartbeat of creation—if he knew how to listen.
From the pre-dawn stillness came voices, carried on the dying night wind. Em's voice, taut as a bowstring, crackling with barely contained lightning. She spoke with someone at the holding Corrl—doubtless the Thel woman who would return to her clan this day. Though her words were lost to distance, the emotion behind them struck his trained senses like hammer blows. Em was fire and impulse, passion before wisdom—and that fire burned hot this morning.

He rose.

Had any witnessed, they would have seen something beyond mortal grace—the transition from absolute stillness to flowing death incarnate. Muscle and sinew moved in perfect harmony, a symphony of destruction clothed in youth's bronze flesh. Beautiful and terrible, like watching a great cat emerge from its lair, every motion screaming of violence barely leashed.

His blade hung beside the sleeping furs, positioned so his hand could find it in the space between heartbeats. Four hundred and sixty-seven cycles this steel had drunk blood for the Ubu clan, through every war, every raid, every desperate last stand. Men whispered it was god-blessed, this ancestral fang that had carved the clan's legend in enemy bone.

As his fingers closed around the familiar grip, the old words rose unbidden from his soul—his grandfather's final gift:
"Understand the weakness of steel, boy. It does not fail—you fail. It will not break—you break. Steel has no enemies, no dreams, no hungers. Find these flaws in yourself, root them from your heart. Only then is true steel born."

The blade sang from its sheath in a blur of silver lightning, weaving patterns too swift for mortal eyes, then settled across his back in the ancient manner—tilted, ready, eternal.

"What troubles you, Em?"

His voice struck her like a physical blow. She spun, thoughts scattering like startled ravens, and met those jade-green eyes that seemed to burn with inner fire. Heat flooded her face, a crimson banner of desire she could not hide. She tried to smile, to mask the hunger that clawed at her heart.

"Ask her," she whispered, fleeing toward the morning light like a doe before wolves.
His gaze followed until she vanished, then his senses tracked her flight—until movement in the shadows froze his blood to ice.

A ghost stood before him. No—not a ghost. A woman, but one whose very existence sent tremors through his soul. Now it was his turn to feel the flush of confusion, the hammer-blow of recognition without memory.
"I know you," she said, her voice like honey poured over steel. "Arok embraced your blade and found his place among the gods. I thank you, O Ubu, for granting him proper rites."
Arok. The name dragged him back to blood-soaked earth and the song of dying steel. "He suffered nothing," Thorac managed, his voice rough as granite. "I grant clean death to all who face me with courage."
But her face... by Crom's brazen bones, why did it haunt him so? Those eyes, that curve of cheek, the midnight fall of her hair—all familiar as his own heartbeat, yet strange as alien stars.
"What is your name?" The words escaped as barely more than breath.

"I am Isa of the Thel, second daughter to Exle the Lawgiver." Pride rang in her voice like bronze bells, too loud for the dawn's hush.
Exle. The name hit him like a war-hammer to the skull. Memories stirred in the dark caves of his mind—his grandfather's voice, thick with barely controlled rage, that cursed name torn from his throat like a battle cry. His great-grandfather's soothing whispers had followed, but the damage was done. Even as a boy, Thorac had felt the weight of ancient hatred in that single word.

"How do you know my mother?" Isa's voice cut through his reverie, sharp with suspicion.

Without answer, he turned away, his feet carrying him toward his grandfather's Charlok. Questions multiplied like plague rats in his skull, and with them came a strange sensation—as if invisible hands were preparing him for some great leap across an unseen chasm. Not his body, but his very soul seemed to coil like a great spring, readying for a transformation he could not name.
Fate had found him at last, and her name was Isa.

## The Stone of Ends Beginning

```
I will remember, and never forget
Deeds done, no regret

Follow our path to the end of what is right
Before us we know we can not win the fight

We must strive to be that which can not
Change, remove, resist the onslaught

Pass to you a power within
Born to a new life we begin

Rest now my heart you must allow
A gods grace to flow between us somehow

Before you each hand holds a path
In one your life, the other my wrath

Choose you must for our life to go
Turn my back and embrace a seed to sow

Two hearts apart we lived our life
Two hearts together we died in strife

So my brother, care not for the whispers of today
For they will never understand what it is at the gods heart we lay
```

## The Confrontation with Orthox

The journey back to Orthox's remote Corac took most of the remaining night. Syalla had insisted on coming, her keeper's wisdom telling her that some truths required witnesses. As they approached the modest dwelling carved into the hillside, Thorac felt the weight of approaching revelation settling upon his shoulders like armor before battle.

His grandfather was awake, sitting before the dying embers of his fire, as if he had been expecting them. The ancient warrior's eyes took in the sight of his grandson approaching with a Thel keeper, and something in his weathered face shifted—a recognition, perhaps, of destiny finally arriving to collect its due.

"Grandfather," Thorac began, but Orthox raised a scarred hand for silence.

"I can smell the blood on your blade, boy, and I can read the weight in your step. You have learned something tonight that has shaken the foundations of what you believed to be true." The old man's voice was steady, but Thorac could hear the tremor beneath it—not of fear, but of long-suppressed emotion finally stirring to life.

"This is Syalla, keeper of the Thel," Thorac said formally. "She carries prophecy stones that speak of unity between our clans."

Orthox studied the young woman for a long moment. "And what has this keeper told you that brings you to my door in the dark hours before dawn?"

Thorac stepped forward, his hand instinctively moving to the stone that held his mother's final words. "She has told me things that make sense of memories I never understood. About Essa of the Thel. About forbidden births. About a woman named Exle."

At the mention of that last name, Orthox's composure cracked. His hands, still powerful despite his age, slowly clenched into fists. When he looked up at his grandson, his eyes held a pain so deep it seemed to echo across generations.

"Exle," he whispered, and in that single word was the weight of 500 cycles of tradition, love, loss, and sacrifice.

### The Breaking of Chains

Orthox's eyes grew distant, lost in memory. Twenty-three years ago, when the news first reached him...

*It just cannot be, how could such a thing come to pass!* His mind is on fire and only his life of training stems the emotions. Though none can see, all know the great Orthox holds back titanic grief. *My son, our Ubarac, did madness strike you?*

Thorac had never seen his grandfather like this—the iron control that had shaped his entire life finally giving way to the storm beneath. Syalla stepped back respectfully, understanding that she was witnessing something sacred and terrible.

"I remember," Orthox continued, his voice breaking as he stared into his aged, worn, battle-hardened hands. "I looked into these very hands as they slowly clenched into fists while I contemplated what I had just heard from the council of elders."

He rose from his seat by the fire, moving like a man carrying the weight of mountains. "Flashing before me were visions of my father, and father's father, an unbroken chain of Ubaracs stretching back at least 500 cycles. Their experience building, the clan slowly growing, all the sacrifices, hardships, pain. Moving, slowly, surely, the Ubus to one of the higher clans."

Thorac felt his heart breaking as he watched the old warrior's composure crumble. "Grandfather..."

"The chain was broken with one act against the laws!" Orthox's fist slammed against the stone wall of his dwelling. "No more an Ubarac, he would stand alone, banished, his name removed, his life gone. To never hear his son's laughter, his counsel, his wisdom—it was more than I could take."

### The Choice of Love

Orthox turned to face them both, and in his eyes was the terrible clarity of a man who had carried unbearable knowledge for too long. "I left the gathering of elders, abruptly, with no pause, no excuse. No one spoke. I would have no part of their next inevitable act. The Ubu clan needed a Ubarac, and I would have none of it."

"You refused the position," Syalla said softly, understanding dawning in her voice.

"I walked away from everything," Orthox confirmed. "As I walked, my mind drifted to you, Thorac, barely into your third cycle. What would you become now, your life's course changed, unknowing the hardships that awaited you."

The old man moved to where his son's sword—Thorac's father's sword—hung on the wall. His fingers traced the ancient steel with reverence and sorrow.

"I arrived at your father's Charlok, his simple sleeping room at the Ubarac's main structure. There I saw you, pulling yourself up, reaching for your father's blade. This blade—forged beyond the great desert at Thor A Noc mountain by the Pleb, passed from father to son. I had never really cared about its origin; I knew it was Jeminga steel and that was all I cared for. It had served our line well, very well."

Thorac's breath caught as the memory stirred something deep in his mind—a sense of reaching, of wanting something just beyond his grasp.

"Your tiny fingers barely reached and touched the hilt, and you cried. It was obvious you wanted more, but no matter how hard you strove, you could only just barely touch it." Orthox's voice grew thick with emotion. "I watched this all transpire before me, emotions continuing to drench my heart. Was it a smile or frown on my face, in my soul—one could not say. I picked up both sword and child, and before the rise of the next sun, we left for a fringe area of the Ubu's control."

### The Truth of Essa

"But you haven't told me about my mother," Thorac said, his voice barely more than breath upon the wind. "About Essa. About what truly transpired in those dark hours."

Orthox's massive shoulders sagged as if Atlas himself had passed the weight of worlds onto them. "Your mother, Essa of the Thel, was born of a bloodline that stretched back to the first days when men learned to heal with more than steel and fire. Mighty healers, magi, and high teachers of the Thel Almac—their blood flowed in her veins like liquid starlight."

Syalla leaned forward, recognizing the description of one whose name was whispered with reverence even among enemies.

"Her mind was a blade forged of wisdom and tempered in the deep mysteries. She knew the laws not as mere words carved in stone, but as living things with souls and hungers of their own. When lesser minds tangled themselves in the thorns of conflicting law, they came to her as pilgrims to a shrine."

Orthox began to pace like a caged wolf, the story tearing itself free from his throat like a war-cry held too long in check. "Essa was with child during the cursed season—the Clamortic Moon Cycle when birth itself becomes an abomination in the eyes of gods and men. Such a child must be cast into the Well of Sorrows, unnamed and unwept. It was not cruelty—it was necessity, written in blood and tears across a thousand generations."

"The Well of Sorrows," Thorac whispered, the name falling from his lips like a prayer to dark gods.

"Aye, the ancient throat that swallows what must not be allowed to live. Essa knew this truth deeper than her own bones. Yet her healer's wisdom told her that women great with child carried their burden longer during this season of death, as if life itself recoiled from the cursed days. With the secret arts her mother had whispered to her in darkness, early birth was impossible—or so she believed."

## The Impossible Birth

"But the gods mock mortal wisdom," Orthox continued, his voice dropping to the whisper of wind through burial grounds. "Essa gave birth alone in her Charlok, with none to witness the moment when law shattered like glass against fate's iron will."

The fire crackled like distant battle-cries as the weight of revelation settled upon them.

"She had birthed countless babes as a healer, but yours came without pain or struggle—as if you, Thorac, *needed* to draw breath during those final cursed days. Her knowledge could have delayed the moment, pushed you safely past the season of death. But fate is a river that flows where it will, not where mortals would have it go."

Orthox's voice cracked like breaking stone. "She cleaned your perfect form and wrapped you in the softest furs, then placed you in her bed while tears fell like rain upon your sleeping face. She did not close her eyes that night—only stared at the beautiful doom she had brought into the world, knowing that dawn would bring a cascade of sorrows that would drown them all."

## The Moment of Truth

"Your father—my son, my pride, my curse—awoke to find Essa weeping upon his chest. His warrior's senses read the truth in an instant: she was diminished, the child no longer within her. He lifted her slight form as gently as a man might handle spun glass and placed her upon the sleeping furs."

Thorac found himself holding his breath, seeing in his mind's eye the father whose face he had never known.

"He caressed that face which had been his lodestone since the day he won her heart in his first clan raid. The face that had given meaning to his existence, that had transformed a killer into something approaching a man. Now that same face bore the mark of tragedy that would consume them both."

"'You know what I must do?' he said, his voice like iron scraping stone. He turned to leave, to fulfill the duty that would tear his soul from his body. But Essa called to him—her voice soft as silk, deadly as poison. When he paused, she rose and walked to him like a ghost seeking redemption, her lips barely touching his ear as she began to whisper the words that would damn them all."

## The Conspiracy of Love

Orthox's eyes grew distant, as if gazing through the veils between worlds. "They stood locked in that embrace while she spoke and he listened. As her words sank into his soul, fire began to burn in his eyes—not the clean flame of rage, but something darker, more terrible. The veins in his mighty arms stood out like the roots of some ancient tree, and his vitality became a force that filled the room like the breath of sleeping dragons."

"What words could work such sorcery?" Syalla asked, her voice barely audible.

"She told him exactly what he would do, because her mind—sharp as any blade ever forged—had seen all possibilities before she ever spoke his name in the darkness. She knew his father's rage would burn like the fires of the first hell, but she also knew what his choice would be. He would flee, would take their son into exile, would live with their shame in whatever peace the world might grant them."

Orthox's voice grew hard as winter iron. "She knew her Ubarac's heart as she knew the phases of the moon. Once she laid her reasoning before him like a battle-plan, once she showed him how they could choose their own fate rather than submit to the dice-roll of chance, she knew he would follow where her wisdom led."

"She broke from that strange embrace and spoke words that echo still in my nightmares: 'It must be so, my beloved.' Her hand caressed his face—that face she had seen in passion and fury, in victory and joy, and now in a sorrow deeper than the Well itself. This was the incarnation of emotion she feared most, for she knew he commanded all others like a general commands his armies. But this—this grief that threatened to tear him apart—was beyond any man's control."

"'I know your heart, my Ubarac, as I know the laws that bind us,' she whispered, wiping away tears that seemed reluctant to leave his weathered cheek."

## The Final Sacrifice

"He walked to where you lay sleeping, lifted you in arms that had held death a thousand times but never life so precious. He whispered words into your ear that only the gods were meant to hear—perhaps a blessing, perhaps a curse, perhaps simply the sound of a father's heart breaking."

Orthox paused, his fists clenched until the knuckles showed white as bone. "But when the moment came to carry you to the Well of Sorrows, when duty demanded he cast his own blood into that ancient throat—he found he could not. He stood paralyzed between law and love, between honor and horror."

Thorac felt hot tears carving paths down his cheeks. "What broke the deadlock?"

"He came to me as dawn painted the sky the color of fresh blood, carrying you in his arms. His face bore the marks of weeping, but his eyes held a resolve terrible to behold. 'Father,' he said, 'when the clan discovers what has transpired, they will surely name you stand-in Ubarac until a permanent successor can be chosen. You must refuse this honor.'"

Orthox's voice grew thick with the weight of memory. "I demanded explanation for this madness. He placed you in my arms—so small, so perfect, so doomed—and spoke words that haunt me still: 'You must take Thorac into the waste places, bringing dishonor upon yourself. Do not question me, do not hesitate—be the beginning that Essa whispered to me in the darkness.'"

"We argued like titans beneath that blood-red sky. I raged at him for asking me to abandon everything our fathers had carved from the savage world with blade and blood. He wept and begged, telling me that Essa had seen something in her final moments—a vision that demanded this sacrifice from us both."

The old warrior's voice softened like steel cooled in gentle rain. "But then I looked into his eyes and saw not the broken man I had expected, but my son—the boy I had raised with iron discipline, the warrior I had forged in the fires of combat, the leader who had made me proud beyond words. In that moment, love proved stronger than law, and I understood that he asked not betrayal, but salvation."

"When I agreed to bear the burden he laid upon me, he withdrew Essa's scroll from his robes—that final message she had sealed before choosing her own dark path. 'She commanded me to give this to you when the moment came,' he said, pressing it into my hands with the reverence of a priest handling sacred relics. 'But only when you understood why the sacrifice was necessary. Only when you chose love over law as she chose.'"

Orthox's voice became cold as the breath of winter gods. "So I did his bidding. Before that accursed sun could rise fully, I had departed for the fringe territories with you in my arms, bearing the dishonor he had asked of me, trusting in wisdom I could not comprehend, carrying the words your mother had sealed for this very hour."

"And my father?"

"He remained to face the elders' judgment, though he could no longer serve as Ubarac. The chain of five hundred cycles was shattered—not by his flight, but by his refusal to enforce the very laws he had sworn to uphold." Orthox's fists clenched at the bitter memory. "I would play no part in naming his successor, would not serve the clan that demanded my grandson's death. So I chose exile with you rather than watch him destroy himself on the altar of duty."

The old warrior's voice dropped to a whisper like wind through ancient graves. "Essa knew how long the ride to the Well of Sorrows would take. She saw in her mind's eye the riders who would be dispatched to investigate their Ubarac's absence, knew that by then the clan would understand that she had given birth during the forbidden time."

"Her sharp mind had foreseen it all before she ever woke him from sleep. She knew my rage would burn like forge-fire, but she also knew what path I would choose—exile over dishonor, love over law, hope over the crushing weight of tradition."

"When she heard the distant horns announcing the riders' return, she held you one final time in her heart—though you were already gone from her arms. She placed herself beside your father's blade, that wonderful steel that had been her protector and would now be her deliverer. Without looking back, without tears for any to see, she drifted toward whatever gods await those who choose their own ending."

The silence stretched like a drawn bowstring before Orthox found strength to continue. "She was discovered the next morning with a smile upon her lips and eyes that gazed into realms no living soul can see. In her dead hand she clutched a scroll, freshly scribed and sealed in the ancient way—a message that only her grandfather's hand could lawfully break."

The fire had burned low during the telling, and in its dying light, three faces bore the marks of those who had heard truth too terrible and too beautiful for mortal hearts to bear.

### The Weight of Truth

Syalla's voice cut through the silence like a blade through silk. "The scroll you mentioned—the one sealed with blood and prophecy."

Orthox's granite features darkened. "Aye. I have borne that cursed thing for years, waiting for the gods to show me the hour. Perhaps..." His eyes, deep as mountain caves, fixed upon his grandson. "Perhaps the hour has come at last."
"But there's more blood in this tale, isn't there?" Thorac's voice carried the weight of dawning understanding. "About Exle. About Isa."

The old Ubarac's fists clenched until the knuckles cracked like breaking bones. "Your father's exile was no simple banishment. In those years of wandering, hollow with grief and rage, he found... solace. Exle was a lawgiver, yes—one who understood the crushing weight of impossible choices, the taste of blood on the tongue when duty demands sacrifice."

"She cast judgment on my birth," Thorac said, the words falling like stones into still water.

"She cast the deciding vote to feed you to the crows," Orthox confirmed, his voice rough as granite grinding granite. "And years later, in bitter irony that would make the gods themselves laugh, she bore your father another child in the same cursed season. The same forbidden time that brought you screaming into this world."

Syalla's breath hissed between her teeth. "Isa... by Bel's brass throne, she truly is..."

"His blood-sister, born of guilt and desperate hunger, raised believing herself pure Thel blood." Orthox's voice carried the weight of mountains. "When I learned of it, when I discovered that the woman who would have seen my grandson's bones picked clean by ravens had herself shattered the very laws she wielded like a sword... the rage burned in me like forge-fire. I could have killed her with my bare hands and counted it justice."

"During times of hardship she was born, and not cast to oblivion by law," Orthox intoned, his voice taking on the cadence of ancient doom-speakers. "An Ubarac who breaks law stands alone—no more shall he rule. Child of the unknown, pass through to life, and understand how your birth doomed a man to walk in shadows."

He moved to a hidden alcove carved into the stone wall and withdrew an ancient scroll, its seal bearing the writhing serpent mark of Essa's bloodline. "This has waited in darkness long enough. Time to learn what your mother's witch-sight truly saw in the flames of prophecy."

As Orthox raised the scroll to break its ancient seal, the thunder of hooves shattered the pre-dawn silence. A lone rider approached like a harbinger of fate, his mount foam-flecked and near death. The figure that dismounted was ancient as weathered stone, bent with years but with eyes that burned like coals in the darkness.

"Orthox of the Ubu!" the old man called, his voice carrying the authority of one who had pronounced judgment on kings. "I am Valdric, blood-grandfather to Essa of the Thel. My granddaughter's grandmother came to me through the spirit-paths, pressing upon me an urgency I could not name. She knew not why, only that the gods demanded it. I have ridden three horses to death to reach this cursed place."

Thorac stared at this figure of legend made flesh. Valdric's burning gaze found his, and a smile like winter sunrise creased the ancient lawgiver's face.

"And you must be Thorac, son of prophecy. I have not laid eyes upon you since you were a wolf-cub, yet I have watched your path from afar, marking each victory with the pride of blood-kin. Your mother's fire burns bright in your veins."
Orthox extended the scroll with hands that trembled—not from age, but from the weight of destiny finally coming to fruition. "Then perhaps it is your hand that must break what your granddaughter sealed with blood and tears."

Valdric took the scroll as if it were a coiled serpent, his fingers tracing the intricate seal with the reverence of one handling sacred relics. "This is Essa's work, sealed with arts known only to the deepest mysteries. Only my hand can break this binding without destroying what lies within."

From his travel-worn pouch, he withdrew a tool of blackened metal, carved with symbols that seemed to writhe in the firelight like living things. "Each lawgiver bears one of these—forged in the first days when men learned to bind words with power. It serves not merely to break seals, but to bear witness that this hand, and no other, opened what was meant to remain closed."

With ritual precision, he applied the tool to the ancient wax. The seal parted with a sound like souls escaping flesh, and the parchment unfolded as if eager to finally speak its dark secrets.
Valdric's voice took on the sonorous power of prophecy itself, each word weighted with the authority of gods and fate:

"To my beloved son, should he live to read these words written in shadow and blood: You are not the dying echo of something broken, but the first cry of something reborn. In your veins flows the mingled blood of enemies, the hope of warring clans locked in eternal strife. The strength of your living hand will transform the laws that would have fed your infant flesh to the crows.

Know this truth: your father's path of exile leads him to another who bears the crushing weight of judgment—and from that union of the damned will come a sister born of different mothers but sharing the fire of your blood. Seek out this child of two worlds when the gods decree the time has come, for together you are the bridge across the chasm our hatred carved.

Two children of forbidden seasons, two living violations of ancient law—in your joining of purpose, the clans will find unity or face extinction. The stone of endings and beginnings rests not in death's cold embrace, but in the courage to choose love over law, unity over the comfortable hatred of tradition.

The gods have marked you both not for destruction, but for the greatest deed warriors can perform—the healing of wounds that have festered like poison in the tribal soul. Be the bridge, my son. Find your blood-sister. Together, be the answer to prayers that have not yet found voice in mortal throats."

Silence fell like a shroud over the four as the words settled into their souls. Outside, the first pale light of dawn began to creep across the horizon, marking the end of the Clamortic Moon Cycle and the birth of an age unwritten in any chronicle.

Orthox studied the exhausted lawgiver and grunted with grudging approval. "Valdric, you look like hammered bronze left too long in the rain. Plant yourself in that chair before you fall on your face like a felled tree."

He gestured toward the fire, then began rummaging through his stores with the methodical precision of a man who knew where every treasure lay hidden. Finally, from the deepest shadows of his hoard, he withdrew a bottle bearing the sacred markings of the high clans.
"Gristation Ale," he announced with the satisfaction of a general revealing his secret weapon. "Brewed in the old way, for occasions when the gods themselves come calling."

Valdric's response was a laugh like distant thunder rolling across mountain peaks—deep, rich, and filled with the wild joy of men who have lived to see impossible prophecies fulfilled.
