# The Stone of Ends Beginning
*A Sword and Sorcery Tale*

## Opening Prophecy

```
Can we bring our plea to gods above,
Transform us past these binding laws?
Without law's structure, we dissolve—
With law's constraint, we cannot evolve.

We know that stone, once carved, stays true,
The etched words hold what we can't undo.
Through these wounds we forge a sacred space,
A time for all to heal with grace.

In change, we find a deeper love,
Together building worlds thereof.
Fire transforms the hardest stone—
From what we were to what we've grown.
```

## The Raid

The blade of his grandsire had never sung so sweet in Thorac's iron grip. Forged in the ancient fires and quenched in the blood of kings, it had drunk deep of enemy life for three generations. When he had emerged first from the U Tar Uboc—the Trial of Manhood—last summer under the crimson moon, old Orthox had waited with the ancestral steel gleaming in his weathered hands. The former Ubarac's eyes had blazed with fierce pride as he passed the weapon to his grandson, for in that moment, Thorac had become Utorac—a warrior of the clan.

These memories flickered through his mind like flame-shadows as death rushed toward him on five pairs of legs. The Thel warriors saw only his clan markings, read only the simple rank of Utorac, and grinned with wolf-like hunger. What was one against five? What hope had a single blade against their combined steel?

They could not know they faced the deadliest killer the savage Ubu had ever spawned—young Thorac, whose name would one day shake the very foundations of their world and usher in an age of blood and iron.
The Emorac raids always intensified during the Clamortic Moon Cycle, when the long nights approached and desperate clans rolled the bones of fate. In the harsh wastelands of Zulac, theft was a coward's game, but taking by strength—whether of arm or wit—was the natural law of survival.

The Thel had learned this truth when their great dam shattered like a giant's toy, drowning their crops in brown flood-water and toppling their sacred Almac—the House of Teaching. Ancient scrolls dissolved, carved stones cracked, and with them died the accumulated wisdom of generations. Now they faced the choice all desperate clans must face: raid or starve.
So the Thel elders had cast their lots and spoken their war-prayers. One great strike against the Ubu—swift, brutal, decisive. Success would mean survival for their children and glory-songs carved in stone for all the tribes to remember. Each warrior bore not just his weapons, but the weight of his people's fate and the hungry eyes of his kin.

The elders knew what the young bloods did not—that victory would birth legends, but defeat would birth only graves. They had walked through their ruined city, seen the hollow eyes of their women and the swollen bellies of starving children. The gods demanded sacrifice, and tonight, beneath alien stars, that debt would be paid in full.

Aye, there would be a poem stone carved this night—but not the one either clan expected, and written in blood darker than any scribe's ink.

## The Witness

```
She glimpsed his power—held her blade in check.
He saw her beauty—stayed his killing blow.
United, they crumbled into separate wrecks,
Divided, into deeper love they'd grow.

What law forbade, desire dared to make,
What duty killed, their hearts conspired to wake.
With the dangerous seed of change between them cast—
They planted futures that would break the past.
```

---

Marrka struck first, his war-cry splitting the twilight air—but the Utorac was already there, moving like shadow given flesh. Had the young Thel stumbled on some hidden root? Or had death itself reached out with invisible claws?
By Bel's black throne—Marrka crumpled without a sound, crimson spreading beneath him like spilled wine. The others barely had time to blink before steel sang its harvest song, and where five warriors had charged, only silence remained.

All save Arok.

He stood alone in that circle of the dead, close enough to see his own doom reflected in the Utorac's pitiless eyes. No fear touched his heart—fear was for lesser men. But hopelessness? Aye, that cold serpent coiled in his belly as he gazed upon his fallen sword-brothers. Some had died with prayers on their lips, others with curses, but all had died.

Arok felt his blade grow heavy as lead. His sword-arm trembled, began to fall—then stopped. He looked down in wonder. The Utorac's ancestral steel had caught his own blade, holding it suspended between earth and sky like some ritual offering.
When Arok raised his eyes, he saw eternity waiting.

His breath sighed out like wind through autumn leaves, and he sank down among his brothers. From somewhere beyond the veil, he heard the voices of his gods calling—ancient voices, patient and kind. Sleep came easy then, for in those divine eyes he glimpsed the peace that awaits all warriors when their last battle is done.

Thus passed Arok of the Thel, and with him died the hopes of his doomed clan.

## The Teaching of Time

```
Time's iron chains bind every mortal soul,
Yet wise men learn to make the tyrant kneel.
Compress each moment—stretch your will's control,
While lesser minds let precious seconds steal.

The master sees what fools can never know:
Not time that shifts, but consciousness within.
Transform the flesh—new thoughts begin to flow,
Reshape the mind—the soul's true work begins.

Forge soul anew, and time becomes your slave,
Its ancient grip now serves your deeper will.
The clock still turns, the hours still engrave
Their passage—but you choose to move or still.

Who conquers self conquers eternity,
Makes a servant of what once held sovereignty.
```

## The Keeper's Proposal

Thorac stood among the fallen, his grandfather's blade still humming with the memory of swift death. The Clamortic moonlight painted the battlefield silver, and in that ethereal glow, he saw her. She emerged from behind the ancient standing stones that marked the boundary between Ubu and neutral lands—a figure that should not exist in this place of sudden violence.

She was Thel, he could tell by the braided copper wire wound through her dark hair and the geometric patterns etched into her leather armor. Yet she had not charged with her clan brothers. She had watched. Witnessed. And now she approached with neither weapon drawn nor fear in her stride.

"You fight like the old stories speak of the Ubumak," she said, her voice carrying the musical cadence of the teaching songs. "As if time bends around your blade."

Thorac's grip tightened on his sword, though something in her manner gave him pause. "You are Thel. Your brothers came to steal our harvest, our knowledge. Why do you not join them in death or flee to your broken dam?"

She stopped three paces away—close enough to speak without shouting, far enough that sudden movement would be seen. "Because I have seen what the teaching stones prophesy. Because sometimes witnessing is more important than acting."

The wind shifted, carrying with it the scent of distant rain and the metallic tang of spilled blood. Above them, the Clamortic moon reached its apex, and Thorac felt the familiar stirring that came when the gods paid attention to mortal affairs.

"Speak your name, daughter of Thel, before I decide whether you join your kinsmen or walk away into the night."

"I am Syalla of the Thel, keeper of our remaining teaching stones, and I have come not to raid but to offer a different path." She gestured to the fallen warriors. "This raid was born of desperation, not malice. My people starve not from laziness but from calamity. Your blade has proven we chose poorly."

---

## The Prophecy Revealed

```
Blood calls to blood across the years
Stone calls to stone across the void
What was broken seeks to mend
What was sundered seeks to join
In the space between the clans
New laws are born from old demands
The witness and the warrior stand
Where fate writes with mortal hands
```
---

Thorac had expected many things when he set out to patrol the borderlands that night, but a Thel keeper offering parlance was not among them. Keepers were sacred among all the clans—they who memorized the teaching stones and carried the accumulated wisdom of their people. To harm one brought the wrath of not just their clan, but of the gods themselves.

"You risk much coming here alone, Keeper. Your clan raids us, and I have answered with steel. The law of the borderlands is clear."

Syalla nodded slowly, her eyes never leaving his. "The law is clear, but the law is also incomplete. The teaching stones speak of times when the old ways must give birth to new ones. When calamity strikes, sometimes survival requires more than might or cleverness. Sometimes it requires wisdom."

She reached into her traveling pouch, moving slowly so he could see she drew no weapon. Instead, she produced a small stone tablet, its surface covered with the intricate markings that denoted a teaching stone of high order.

"This was carved three generations ago by my grandmother's grandmother. She foresaw a time when the Clamortic Moon would witness not just raids and death, but the birth of something new. A joining that would strengthen both clans and herald changes across all of Zulac."

Thorac studied the tablet from where he stood, his warrior's training warring with his curiosity. Orthox had taught him that wisdom came not just from the sword, but from knowing when not to draw it.

"Read it aloud, Keeper. Let the moon and the dead witness your words."

Syalla lifted the stone and began to recite, her voice taking on the formal cadence of the teaching songs:

"When the children of different stones meet at the borderland of their fathers' choosing, when blood has been spilled but wisdom prevails, then shall the clans find strength not in separation but in the joining of their knowledge. The harvest of one shall feed both, the wisdom of both shall guide all, and from their union shall come warriors whose deeds will echo across the ages."

The words hung in the night air like a challenge to the very foundations of their world. Thorac felt the weight of destiny settling around him like a cloak, heavy with possibility and peril.

## Ancient Words

```
Ancient words on newer stones
Prophecy and present meet
What the elders carved in hope
Young hearts now must complete
At the crossing of the paths
Where old grudges die
New stories are born beneath
The eternal sky
```

---

"Your words are pretty, Keeper, and your stone speaks of grand futures. But I see five dead warriors at my feet and hear their clan's children crying hunger in the distance. How does your prophecy answer for their blood?"

Syalla knelt beside the nearest fallen warrior—young Marrka, who had been first to die and perhaps had been the bravest of them all. She placed her hand on his still chest and spoke words in the old tongue, the language reserved for speaking with the dead.

"Their blood was not spilled in vain if it waters the ground where understanding grows," she said, rising. "I propose something that has not been tried since the first clans carved their boundaries in stone. A joining of our peoples, not through conquest but through choice. Your harvest shared with our need, our remaining teaching stones shared with your wisdom. A new clan born from the ashes of old conflicts."

Thorac laughed, but there was no mirth in it. "You speak impossibilities, Keeper. The Ubu and Thel have raided each other since the first stones were carved. We are like fire and water—we cannot exist in the same space without one destroying the other."

"And yet," Syalla said, stepping closer, "fire can heat water without destroying it. Water can cool fire without extinguishing it. Perhaps it is time to discover what we might become together rather than what we have always been apart."

The Clamortic moon began its descent toward the horizon, and with it, Thorac felt the moment of decision approaching like a storm front. Soon, scouts from both clans would come looking for their missing members. Soon, the night's events would demand an accounting that could either end in greater bloodshed or... something else entirely.

He looked at the teaching stone in Syalla's hands, then at the faces of the dead warriors, then finally into her eyes, which held depths he had not expected to find in an enemy.

"If I were to entertain this madness," he said slowly, "what would you propose we do with the dead? How do we explain to our clans that their warriors died not for raid or defense, but for the birth of something that has no name?"

Syalla smiled for the first time since she had appeared, and in that smile, Thorac saw not the enemy he had expected, but the possibility of an ally he had never imagined.

## The Forbidden Birth

"There is something you should know," he said quietly, the weight of old secrets heavy in his voice. "Something that may change how you view this joining you propose."

The keeper tilted her head, sensing the shift in his tone. "Speak, Thorac of the Ubu. The moon witnesses all truths tonight."

He looked down at his grandfather's blade, remembering the day Orthox had placed it in his hands, remembering the stories that had been whispered but never fully told. The Clamortic Moon seemed to pulse above them, as if the very cosmos demanded this revelation.

"I was born during the Clamortic Moon Cycle," he said simply, and watched as understanding dawned in Syalla's eyes.

---

## The Child Who Should Not Be

```
Forbidden birth beneath cursed moon
A child who should not be
Yet walks among the living still
Defying destiny
What laws were broken for his breath?
What love paid such a price?
The answer lies in shadows deep
Where sacrifice meets sacrifice
```

---

"Impossible," Syalla breathed, though even as she spoke the word, she knew it was not. Her keeper's training had taught her to read the signs that others missed, and now she saw them clearly in Thorac's bearing, in the way the moonlight seemed to cling to him, in the otherworldly grace with which he had moved in battle.

"My mother was Essa of the Thel," Thorac continued, and Syalla's sharp intake of breath told him she knew the name. "She was gifted with deep wisdom and understanding of the laws. She knew what my birth would mean, knew the price that would be demanded."

He began to pace, his grandfather's blade still in his hand, catching the silver light. "The law was clear—I should have been cast into the Well of Sorrows. But my father, the Ubarac who should have enforced that law, could not bear to destroy what he and my mother had created."

Syalla found herself stepping closer, drawn by the power of this impossible tale. "Essa of the Thel was legendary among our people for her wisdom. But she died during that same Clamortic Cycle, and her child..." She paused, the implications crashing over her like a wave. "Her child was said to have been lost to the laws."

"Lost, but not destroyed," Thorac said grimly. "My father chose exile over infanticide. He fled with me in the night, abandoning his position, his clan, his honor. And my mother..." His voice caught slightly. "She chose her own path to the gods rather than live with the consequences of what we had brought upon our peoples."

The keeper of the Thel felt the ancient stones in her memory shifting, rearranging themselves into new patterns of understanding. "And Orthox raised you?"

"My grandfather understood that some laws serve life, and others serve only tradition. He saw in my survival not an affront to the gods, but a sign that perhaps the old ways needed examining." Thorac stopped pacing and faced her directly. "He trained me not just to be a warrior, but to be someone who could look beyond the boundaries our fathers carved in stone."

---

## The Bridge Between Worlds

```
The sins of fathers become the strength of sons
What was forbidden becomes the foundation
In the child of two peoples
Lives the hope of both
Born in defiance of ancient law
Raised in wisdom of new possibility
The bridge between worlds
Stands ready to be crossed
```

---

Syalla stared at him with new eyes, seeing not just the warrior who had slain her kinsmen, but the living embodiment of everything her prophecy stones had foretold. "You carry the blood of both our clans," she whispered. "Ubu strength and Thel wisdom, forged in the fire of forbidden love."

"And you wonder why your raid tonight felt like destiny rather than chance," Thorac replied. "I have spent my life knowing that I should not exist, yet here I stand. Perhaps it is time to stop apologizing for surviving and start understanding why the gods allowed it."

The dead warriors lay between them, but now their sacrifice seemed less like waste and more like the price of transformation. Syalla knelt again beside young Marrka, but this time her words were different.

"Your blood waters the ground where a new tree will grow," she said softly. "One with roots in both our soils, branches reaching toward a sky we have never dared to imagine."

She rose and looked at Thorac with growing certainty. "The teaching stones speak of a time when the children of different clans would meet at the borderlands. But they never said it would be one child, carrying both bloodlines in his veins."

"My mother left a sealed scroll when she died," Thorac said slowly, pieces of a larger puzzle beginning to fit together. "Orthox has never opened it, waiting for what he calls 'the proper moment.' Perhaps..."

"Perhaps that moment is now," Syalla finished. "When her son stands where she envisioned, facing the choice between perpetuating the old cycles or forging something entirely new."

The Clamortic Moon continued its descent, but neither of them felt the pressure of time as they had before. Instead, there was a sense of inevitability, as if all the years of exile, training, and preparation had led to this single conversation in a field strewn with the dead.

"If we do this," Thorac said carefully, "if we attempt this joining you propose, it will not be a simple matter of sharing resources. The revelation of my parentage alone could tear both clans apart. Some will see it as vindication of an ancient prophecy. Others will see it as proof that the laws exist for good reason."

Syalla nodded gravely. "And yet, what is the alternative? Your existence proves that life finds a way beyond the confines of law. Perhaps it is time our peoples did the same."

She reached into her traveling pouch again and withdrew another stone, this one older and more worn than the first. "This belonged to Essa herself. It was returned to us after her death, though we never knew why she had carried it or what it meant."

Thorac took the stone with reverent hands, feeling the weight of his mother's touch still lingering in its carved surface. The markings were unlike any he had seen before—part Thel, part Ubu, but something more as well.

---

## Essa's Final Words

```
She who saw beyond the veil of time
Carved these words with dying breath:
Laws that serve death over life
Are laws that deserve to die
In the joining of what was separate
In the healing of what was broken
The future writes itself in stone
With love as its chisel
```

---

The words seemed to burn themselves into Thorac's mind as he read them by moonlight. Here was his mother's final gift—not just her blessing for what he might become, but her challenge to make her sacrifice meaningful.

"She knew," he said quietly. "Somehow, she knew this night would come."

"The question now," Syalla said, "is whether we dare to honor her vision or the wisdom to know if we should."

## The Recognition

But even as Thorac held his mother's final stone, another memory stirred—one more recent, yet no less significant. The morning when he had awakened to find Em speaking tensely with the Thel woman who was to be returned to her clan. The morning when he had looked upon a face that called to something profound in his blood.

"There is something else," he said slowly, his mind racing through connections he had not understood until now. "A few days ago, there was a Thel woman at our holding. Isa, daughter of Exle the law-giver. She spoke of her brother Arok, who died by my blade in an earlier skirmish."

Syalla's eyes widened. "Isa is my cousin, though we were raised apart. But why do you speak of her now?"

Thorac felt the weight of revelation settling upon him like a mantle. "Because when I looked upon her, I felt what I had never felt before. A recognition that went deeper than sight or sound. And when she spoke her mother's name—Exle—I remembered my grandfather's rage at hearing it, though I was too young then to understand."

The keeper's sharp mind began working through the implications. Exle was one of the law-givers who ruled on Clamortic births. She would have been involved in any decision about..." She paused, the terrible possibility dawning on her.

"About what to do with a forbidden child," Thorac finished grimly. "But what if her involvement was more than professional? What if the law-giver herself broke the very laws she enforced?"

---

## Hidden Truths

```
Blood calls to blood across the years
Though scattered by law and fear
In the children of different mothers
Lives the truth of hidden brothers
What was severed by decree
Seeks reunion destiny
The sins of fathers, mothers too
Find redemption in what their children do
```

---

Syalla stared at him with growing amazement. "You think Isa is your half-sister? That your father and Exle..."

"I think my father's exile was longer and more complex than the stories tell," Thorac said. "And I think the anger between our clans runs deeper than territorial disputes. It runs through bloodlines that were severed by law and shame."

The implications crashed over both of them like a tide. If Thorac was right, then the joining of their clans was not just politically necessary—it was a family reunion long overdue. The very laws that had torn their families apart could be healed through their unity.

"We must bring this to Orthox," Syalla said urgently. "And to Isa. If she is indeed your sister, then she has a right to know. And more than that—she could be the key to convincing both our peoples that this union is not just possible, but destined."

Thorac nodded slowly, feeling the threads of fate weaving themselves into patterns he was only beginning to understand. "But first, we must deal with what lies before us. These dead warriors need explanation, and both our clans will be looking for answers come dawn."

He looked at the fallen Thel raiders, then at Syalla, then at his mother's stone still glowing faintly in the moonlight. "Perhaps it is time to stop hiding from the truth of what we are and start embracing what we could become."

The Clamortic Moon had nearly set, but neither felt the urgency of its passing anymore. Instead, they felt the slow, inexorable pull of destiny finally asserting itself after years of being denied.

"When I saw Isa," Thorac continued quietly, "I felt something I had never experienced—the presence of family I didn't know existed. If she is my sister, then she has lived her entire life among the Thel, believing herself fully one of them, while I lived among the Ubu, believing the same of myself."

"And now you both discover you are children of two worlds," Syalla said softly. "Living bridges between peoples who have forgotten they were once one."

The wind shifted again, carrying with it the scent of approaching dawn and the weight of changes that could no longer be avoided.

## They Sing for Their Dead

The battle had been no battle at all—merely the brief, brutal education of fools. Five Thel warriors lay sprawled in crimson ruin, and Arok the Terrible among them, he whose name was whispered with dread even in the halls of mighty Ubu. Yet they had fallen like wheat before the scythe, children fumbling with wooden toys while death danced among them with steel and sinew.

Magoroc watched from the shadows, his scarred hands unconsciously flexing. By God's iron bones, he had seen slaughter aplenty in his years, but this—this was artistry written in blood. Thorac's blade had flowed like quicksilver, each stroke inevitable as winter's coming. Even now, warriors muttered in hushed tones, questioning what sorcery they had witnessed. Could mortal flesh move with such deadly grace?

The Ubarac studied Thorac with the cold eye of a veteran wolf measuring a rival. Not tall like his grandsire, but built lean and hard as Thocian steel. Dark hair fell to his shoulders, and beneath bronze skin, muscles coiled with each step like serpents beneath silk. He bore his weapons in the ancient manner—sword angled across his broad back, dagger riding high on the baldric. The old ways, Magoroc thought with grim approval. His grandfather's stubborn ways still walked in this one's shadow.

Their greeting held no ceremony of rank or station—only the fierce embrace of kinsmen who had bled together under alien stars. Magoroc's battle-scarred hand gripped the younger man's sword-arm, the ritual touch that said: You are mine, and I am yours, and death shall find no purchase between us.

When the death-rites began, even these sons of slaughter fell silent. The western sun bled crimson across the sky while twin moons rose like watching eyes. The slain lay in ordered rows, faces turned toward the dying light, weapons naked in their lifeless hands. Then came the torch, and flame leaped hungrily skyward as voices rose in the ancient death-song—a barbaric hymn that spoke of glory undying and names carved forever in the stones of time.

```
I will remember...

The reek of burning flesh and splintered bone,
Brother, father, son—now ash alone.
Born in blood beneath a crimson sky,
For clan and steel you chose to die.

We stand like granite in the flame,
And thunder forth your deathless name.
No more your war-cry splits the air,
No more your laughter echoes there.

No more your iron grip in mine,
Lost where battle-ravens dine.
Your blade sang hymns to crimson gods,
While death stalked grim across the sods.

Now cold and still, your fighting done,
Beneath the dying, bloody sun.
Let flame devour what flesh remains—
Your spirit rides the astral planes.

I'll not forget how steel rang true,
Nor honor those your death-song slew.
Though Hel's black gates have claimed your soul,
Your name lives on—fierce, proud, and whole.

I will remember...
```

## The Morning Encounter

He awoke to silence, clean, peaceful silence. As he was trained he did not open his eyes, instead using other, deeper, senses he explored. It was something his Grandfather instilled in him, knowing to open ones eyes shows you are awake. He recalled this training started as a game in his youth, one his Grandfather would carefully mature as time marched.

He could tell that the sun was not yet in play, obviously no light was detected but deeper still the air was that special sweetness before twilight.

It was something he always cherished, a moment when just before the first light you could hear deep into the fading night. The faint sound of the Amfor tree stirred and the fading winds were there.

He pushed deeper into the night, and found a voice. His sharp senses focused it and reached into themselves and found it was Em and he could tell she was speaking to some one. He felt how tense the words were being conveyed, the emotion was rich, like the air before the storm. He reached deeper, and believed she was at the holding Corrl, and thus she must be speaking with the Thul woman who was to be returned to her clan today. What she was saying was beyond even the reach of his trained senses, however it was clear it was a tense moment for Em. She was rash, he knew, and prone to emotions before reflecting on there origins, he suspected this was in play now, and this guided his actions.

He arose.

If any had been there to witness they would have witnessed him transition from total rest into what can only be described as pure motion, fluid, efficient motion. The effect was in one sense beautiful to watch, with rippling muscles moving as one, a body young, trained, gifted. The other sight this silent witness would have realized is all this was for violence and specifically violence against others. In this he was the product of the crushing forces at play in his world. Simply put, there was not a lot, and so what there was, needed to be kept at all cost, defended, and protected. Life was either held though force, or taken through the application of greater force. It was simple, and like his motion it was pure, and connected to all around him.

After he finished dressing, he stared at his blade which was hung next to his sleeping furs in such a way that he could have had it at a moments notice ready, he knew, to deal death to any fiend or foe. In fact they would have noted his sword was always kept within reach, his clothes laid out the night before in such a way to never block his access to his blade. Such a wonderful weapon he thought to himself, its balance perfect, edge true, steel blessed, and its clan worth established. It carried with it a legend deeper then any single man for was this not the blade of his Ubarac lineage. Its age was known, well at least its time with the Ubu's known. Part of Ubu culture for 467 cycles, actively embracing every major conflict in that time span, this blade had been a deep part of the Ubu's success, many spoke that it was god blessed.

As he reaches for it he whispers to himself the words his grandfather imbued into his very being.

"Understand the weakness of steel. It does not fail, you fail. It will not break, it is you who breaks. It has no enemies, no dreams, no needs. Find these in yourself, look for these in your heart. When found true steel is born."

Again we continue to observe him, and a sudden there is movement, the blade a blur in his hands. Complex motions that seemingly can not be confined in such a tight space. As it begins, so it ends, the sword at rest in his scabbard, old style, tilted slightly on his back.

"What bothers you so Em?" The question, nay the voice, his voice... startles her. Thoughts lose focus, washed aside as she turns and sees him staring into her eyes. Those green eyes, so pure, deep, she feels his gaze as though a fire was burning close to her face. She is flushed, she knows he sees this, and the flush gets deeper. She fakes a smile, trying to hide her awe, passion, desire.

She breaks the contact, stares at her feet and mutters, "Ask her..", and Em rushes off into the morning light. His gaze follows her, and when she leaves his vision, his senses follow just as he turns to stare upon a ghost.

It is now his turn to flush, be startled, confused. His endless gaze breaks when she speaks. "I know you, Arok is with our gods having embraced your blade, and I thank you O'Ubu for giving him proper rights". These words break his spell, and he stammers, mind a swirl, finally digesting the words. "Yes, I remember your brother, and his comrades, they suffered naught, which is always my goal in battle". Her eyes, hair, shape of her very face, he can not place it. "Who is she, why do I feel so connected to her?" he thinks to himself as he continues to gaze at her. "What is your name?", it is almost a whisper, she is taken aback by the quite tone from one such as he.

"I am Isa of the Thel, second daughter to Exle, our law giver", she proudly states much louder then was needed considering their distance and the morning silence.

"Exle", he continued to whisper almost to himself recalling his grandfather having mentioned her, but when? He dove into his subconscious, running through his memories, digging, rummaging, his head cocking at a slight angle.

"Yes Exle, do you know my mother", she said now in a more controlled tone, her interest in his strange reaction fully engaged.

He found it, and he looked up at Isa trying to understand the connection. He had been young, his great grandfather had been visiting his grandfathers remote Corac. It was not a strange visit, since both men were related to him, one through his mothers side, the other through his father. As was the custom with the young in training he was doing his final sequences before sleep. His routine was interrupted by his grandfathers heavy fist slamming into the the wall of the other room, with one word being spoken in uncontrolled fury... "Exle!" His anger and tone were quickly controlled by his great grandfathers soothing voice and Thorac heard no more of it.

This memory now raced into his mind as he looked upon Isa.

"Who are you?", he thought to himself, however again she answered so his words must have escaped.

"I am Isa, did not you hear me the first time, how do you know my mother Exle?", she said again with a hint of anger.

He turned and left with out acknowledging, and started toward his grandfathers Charlok, questions beginning to grow in his mind as more bits of memories started to come forth and focus his actions. Something whispered in his soul, it was a tickling of fate upon him, something new to him, as though he was about to move. Not in a physical sense as one prepares to jump a challenging distance, but the same in that he felt movement was about to begin, and part of him, deep parts in his being, were starting to prepare and ready him for... what?

## The Stone of Ends Beginning

```
I will remember, and never forget
Deeds done, no regret

Follow our path to the end of what is right
Before us we know we can not win the fight

We must strive to be that which can not
Change, remove, resist the onslaught

Pass to you a power within
Born to a new life we begin

Rest now my heart you must allow
A gods grace to flow between us somehow

Before you each hand holds a path
In one your life, the other my wrath

Choose you must for our life to go
Turn my back and embrace a seed to sow

Two hearts apart we lived our life
Two hearts together we died in strife

So my brother, care not for the whispers of today
For they will never understand what it is at the gods heart we lay
```

## The Confrontation with Orthox

The journey back to Orthox's remote Corac took most of the remaining night. Syalla had insisted on coming, her keeper's wisdom telling her that some truths required witnesses. As they approached the modest dwelling carved into the hillside, Thorac felt the weight of approaching revelation settling upon his shoulders like armor before battle.

His grandfather was awake, sitting before the dying embers of his fire, as if he had been expecting them. The ancient warrior's eyes took in the sight of his grandson approaching with a Thel keeper, and something in his weathered face shifted—a recognition, perhaps, of destiny finally arriving to collect its due.

"Grandfather," Thorac began, but Orthox raised a scarred hand for silence.

"I can smell the blood on your blade, boy, and I can read the weight in your step. You have learned something tonight that has shaken the foundations of what you believed to be true." The old man's voice was steady, but Thorac could hear the tremor beneath it—not of fear, but of long-suppressed emotion finally stirring to life.

"This is Syalla, keeper of the Thel," Thorac said formally. "She carries prophecy stones that speak of unity between our clans."

Orthox studied the young woman for a long moment. "And what has this keeper told you that brings you to my door in the dark hours before dawn?"

Thorac stepped forward, his hand instinctively moving to the stone that held his mother's final words. "She has told me things that make sense of memories I never understood. About Essa of the Thel. About forbidden births. About a woman named Exle."

At the mention of that last name, Orthox's composure cracked. His hands, still powerful despite his age, slowly clenched into fists. When he looked up at his grandson, his eyes held a pain so deep it seemed to echo across generations.

"Exle," he whispered, and in that single word was the weight of 500 cycles of tradition, love, loss, and sacrifice.

### The Breaking of Chains

Orthox's eyes grew distant, lost in memory. Twenty-three years ago, when the news first reached him...

*It just cannot be, how could such a thing come to pass!* His mind is on fire and only his life of training stems the emotions. Though none can see, all know the great Orthox holds back titanic grief. *My son, our Ubarac, did madness strike you?*

Thorac had never seen his grandfather like this—the iron control that had shaped his entire life finally giving way to the storm beneath. Syalla stepped back respectfully, understanding that she was witnessing something sacred and terrible.

"I remember," Orthox continued, his voice breaking as he stared into his aged, worn, battle-hardened hands. "I looked into these very hands as they slowly clenched into fists while I contemplated what I had just heard from the council of elders."

He rose from his seat by the fire, moving like a man carrying the weight of mountains. "Flashing before me were visions of my father, and father's father, an unbroken chain of Ubaracs stretching back at least 500 cycles. Their experience building, the clan slowly growing, all the sacrifices, hardships, pain. Moving, slowly, surely, the Ubus to one of the higher clans."

Thorac felt his heart breaking as he watched the old warrior's composure crumble. "Grandfather..."

"The chain was broken with one act against the laws!" Orthox's fist slammed against the stone wall of his dwelling. "No more an Ubarac, he would stand alone, banished, his name removed, his life gone. To never hear his son's laughter, his counsel, his wisdom—it was more than I could take."

### The Choice of Love

Orthox turned to face them both, and in his eyes was the terrible clarity of a man who had carried unbearable knowledge for too long. "I left the gathering of elders, abruptly, with no pause, no excuse. No one spoke. I would have no part of their next inevitable act. The Ubu clan needed a Ubarac, and I would have none of it."

"You refused the position," Syalla said softly, understanding dawning in her voice.

"I walked away from everything," Orthox confirmed. "As I walked, my mind drifted to you, Thorac, barely into your third cycle. What would you become now, your life's course changed, unknowing the hardships that awaited you."

The old man moved to where his son's sword—Thorac's father's sword—hung on the wall. His fingers traced the ancient steel with reverence and sorrow.

"I arrived at your father's Charlok, his simple sleeping room at the Ubarac's main structure. There I saw you, pulling yourself up, reaching for your father's blade. This blade—forged beyond the great desert at Thor A Noc mountain by the Pleb, passed from father to son. I had never really cared about its origin; I knew it was Jeminga steel and that was all I cared for. It had served our line well, very well."

Thorac's breath caught as the memory stirred something deep in his mind—a sense of reaching, of wanting something just beyond his grasp.

"Your tiny fingers barely reached and touched the hilt, and you cried. It was obvious you wanted more, but no matter how hard you strove, you could only just barely touch it." Orthox's voice grew thick with emotion. "I watched this all transpire before me, emotions continuing to drench my heart. Was it a smile or frown on my face, in my soul—one could not say. I picked up both sword and child, and before the rise of the next sun, we left for a fringe area of the Ubu's control."

### The Truth of Essa

"But you haven't told me about my mother," Thorac said quietly. "About Essa. About what really happened."

Orthox's shoulders sagged as if the final weight was settling upon them. "Your mother, Essa of the Thel, was descended of mighty healers, magi, and high teachers of the Thel Almac. Her mind was sharp, deep, and she was known for the wisdom she not only held, but her deep understanding of the laws—the laws that bound all who would be considered man or woman."

Syalla leaned forward, recognizing the description of one of her people's greatest figures.

"She was often consulted when seemingly conflicting laws came into complex play, and she always provided a concise clarity that made her respected across all the tribes, both friend and foe alike. For indeed her grandfather was a law giver of the highest order, and she had found that his gifts mixed well with the gifts from her mother."

Orthox began to pace, the story pouring out of him like water through a broken dam. "Essa was with child, and it was a dangerous time to be gifted with such. For a birth during the Clamortic Moon Cycle was forbidden by law. Such a birth would have to be cast to oblivion by the clan's Ubarac. It was a grim reality, but all knew why the laws could not be broken."

"The Well of Sorrows," Thorac whispered.

"Essa understood, deeper than most, that the Ubarac would take the unnamed child to the clan's Well of Sorrows and cast the unfortunate into its deep bowls. There would be no remorse, there could not be—it was the law. It had been done, she knew, even before the laws. In fact it was such a rare event that many felt the cycle of birth danced around this time of hardship. Was it not true that women with child carried them longer during this dangerous time? So given this and skills passed to her from her mother, it made an early birth impossible, and thus she had no fear for such a transgression."

### The Impossible Birth

"But Essa had given birth," Orthox continued, his voice dropping to barely above a whisper. "Alone in her Charlok, and none had witnessed this."

The fire crackled in the silence as all three absorbed the weight of this revelation.

"She had helped many births as a healer of the clan, and hers was without pain, or even labor. Before she realized it was happening, it was over. As though this child—you, Thorac—needed to be alive in the world during the few remaining days of the Clamortic Moon Cycle. If only she had realized in time, her knowledge would have made it a simple matter to delay, for just a little longer, passing you both into safety."

Orthox's voice broke completely now. "It had not been so, and she understood instantly its meaning. She cleaned and bundled up the wonderful life, and placed you in her bed. She did not sleep; she stared at the beautiful little boy, silently crying and caressing your perfect skin. She would let her Ubarac sleep, and in the pre-morning she would bring him the news she knew would crush his soul and start a cascade of sorrows."

### The Moment of Truth

"Your father—my son—awoke to Essa lying upon him weeping. His trained senses were so keen he immediately understood. She was smaller; he could feel she was without child. He rose, easily lifted her weeping form, and placed her upon his furs."

Thorac found himself holding his breath, seeing in his mind's eye the father he had never truly known.

"He caressed her wonderful face, a face he had known since his first clan raid when he won her heart. A face that had given his life meaning, focus, joy, understanding, and now sorrow. As with all things to him, there were lines he would not cross—in this way he was simple. Though his life and deeds were complex, they danced inside a system of beliefs that were not created, or forged, or influenced by man, law, or clan. They were forged in the fire of his heart, on the day of his birth, and they shaped him, guided him, as the sun guided the earth."

"'You know what I must do?' his steeled voice told her, and he turned away and began to leave. Essa understood, and she watched his wonderful, perfect form. Even in this simple act she could read his broken heart, and she feared for him. She called to him, he paused, she arose and walked to him, reaching her lips till they barely touched his ear and began to whisper."

### The Conspiracy of Love

Orthox's eyes grew distant, as if he could see the scene playing out before him. "They were locked in this for a time—she spoke, he listened, and as he did so a fire began to burn in his eyes, and the veins of his mighty arms began to stand out like branches on a tree. His vitality began to be a tangible force between them, and tears began to move down a face that seemingly had no room for such things."

"What did she tell him?" Syalla asked softly.

"She told him exactly what he would do, because her sharp mind had seen all possibilities before she even awoke him. She knew the rage of his father—my rage—but she also knew what his actions would be. He would leave, he would raise their son, take him far away to live with their disgrace in peace. She also knew her Ubarac, that once he heard her sharp reasoning and she detailed out a course of actions she knew mirrored his heart, and how they were not rolling dice but in fact deciding their own fate, he would follow."

Orthox's voice grew harder, more bitter. "She broke from the strange embrace and it was at this time, if any had been in the room, they would have heard: 'It must be so, my beloved,' and she caressed his rough, handsome face. A face she had seen in passion, anger, joy, victory, and that night in deep sadness. It was this incarnation of emotion that she feared, for she knew he controlled all others, but this was something she felt... no, she knew... he could not control. She thought to herself, 'A man with his power, not in complete control, was an unknown.' Her sharp mind rejected the unknown, for with it came risk, and in this she believed she had reasoned out all risk."

"'I know your heart, my Ubarac, as I know the laws,' she said as she wiped a tear from his face that seemed uncomfortable and reluctant to continue its odd passage."

### The Final Sacrifice

"He walked to her Charlok where he knew you would be. You were asleep; he picked you up, held you, whispered into your ear something only the gods could hear." Orthox's voice grew heavy with the weight of memory. "But when the moment came to leave, to take you to the Well of Sorrows as the law demanded, he could not bring himself to do it. He stood there, holding you, paralyzed between duty and love."

Thorac felt tears he had not expected flowing down his cheeks. "And then?"

"He came to me as dawn approached, carrying you in his arms, his face streaked with tears but his eyes holding a terrible resolve. 'Father,' he said, 'tomorrow when the clan wakes and finds what has transpired, they will surely choose you as stand-in Ubarac until a new one can be found. You must not accept this honor.'"

Orthox's voice grew thick with remembered pain. "I demanded to know what madness had taken hold of him. He placed you in my arms and spoke words that echo still: 'You must take Thorac into isolation, bringing dishonor upon yourself. You must do this, you must not question me, you must be the beginning that Essa whispered to me.'"

"We argued," Orthox continued, his fists clenching. "I raged at him for asking me to abandon everything our fathers had built, to cast aside my duty to the clan. He wept and begged, telling me that Essa had seen something in her final moments, something that demanded this sacrifice from us both."

The old warrior's voice softened. "But then I looked into his eyes and saw not the broken man I had expected, but my son—the boy I had raised, the warrior I had trained, the leader I had been proud of. In that moment, our love for each other transcended our fear and anger at what had happened. I understood that he was not asking me to betray our people, but to save something far more precious."

"When I agreed to do as he asked, he reached into his robes and withdrew Essa's scroll—the one she had sealed before her death. 'She told me to give this to you when the moment came,' he said, pressing it into my hands. 'But only when you understood why the sacrifice was necessary. Only when you chose love over law as she did.'"

Orthox's voice became as cold as winter stone. "So I did his bidding. Before the rise of that sun, I had left with you for the fringe areas of the Ubu's control, carrying the dishonor he had asked me to bear, trusting in wisdom I could not yet understand, and holding in my possession the words your mother had left for this very moment."

"My father stayed?"

"He stayed to face the elders' judgment, though he could no longer serve as Ubarac. The chain of 500 cycles was broken not by his flight, but by his inability to enforce the very laws he had sworn to uphold." Orthox's fists clenched at the memory. "I would have no part in naming a new Ubarac, no part in the clan that would demand the death of my grandson. So I chose exile with you rather than watch him destroy himself with guilt and duty."

"She knew how long it would take to ride to the Ubu's Well of Sorrows. She saw the riders dispatched the next day to investigate their Ubarac's disappearance, and by this time the clan knew Essa had given birth. They all understood, and they all expected the laws to be obeyed."

Orthox's voice became as cold as winter stone. "Her sharp mind had seen all this, and more, before she even awoke her Ubarac. She knew my rage, but she also knew what my actions would be—that I would leave, that I would raise you, take you far away to live with our disgrace in peace."

"She heard the distant call that the riders returned, and she hugged you one last time—though you were already gone—and she placed herself on the floor next to your father's wonderful blade, and she left, did not look back, her weeping not seen."

"She drifted towards her gods, dreamily she heard my rage, my passing by her door, my steps coming to a stop at the Ubarac Charlok."

The silence stretched long and terrible before Orthox continued. "She was found the next day, a smile on her face, staring with eyes that could not see, and in her dead hand she held a scroll that had been recently scribed and sealed in a way that only her grandfather could break by law."

### The Weight of Truth

Syalla spoke into the heavy silence. "The scroll you mentioned—the one you've never opened."

Orthox nodded slowly. "I have carried it for years, waiting for the proper moment. Perhaps..." He looked at his grandson with eyes that held the weight of generations. "Perhaps that moment is now."

"But there's more, isn't there?" Thorac said quietly. "About Exle. About Isa."

The old warrior's face darkened further. "Your father's exile was longer and more complex than even this tale tells. In his wandering, in his pain and loneliness, he found... companionship. Exle was also a law-giver, also someone who understood the weight of impossible choices."

"She was the one who ruled on my birth," Thorac said, understanding dawning.

"She was the one who cast the deciding vote to demand your death," Orthox confirmed grimly. "And she was the one who, years later, bore your father another child in the same forbidden time. The irony was not lost on the gods, it seems."

Syalla gasped. "Isa truly is his half-sister."

"Born of guilt and longing, raised believing herself fully Thel, never knowing her true parentage." Orthox's fists clenched again. "When I learned of it, when I realized that the woman who had condemned my grandson had herself broken the very laws she enforced... the rage nearly consumed me."

### The Stone's Message

"During a time of hardship she was born and not cast to oblivion by law," Orthox recited, his voice taking on the cadence of prophecy. "An Ubarac who breaks law stands alone, no more shall he rule. Child of the unknown, pass through to life, and understand how your birth doomed a man."

He moved to a hidden alcove and withdrew an ancient scroll, its seal bearing the markings of Essa's grandfather. "This has waited long enough. It is time to learn what your mother truly foresaw."

Just as Orthox lifted the scroll to break the seal, the sound of hooves thundered through the pre-dawn air. A lone rider approached at desperate speed, his mount lathered and near collapse. As the figure dismounted, they could see it was an ancient man, bent with age but with eyes that burned with urgent purpose.

"Orthox of the Ubu," the old man called out, his voice carrying despite his obvious exhaustion. "I am Valdric, grandfather to Essa of the Thel. My granddaughter's grandmother came to me just days ago through her gifts, pressing upon me to find you. She did not know why, just that she knew it must be. I have been riding hard since, killing my best horse to reach this place."

Thorac stared at the weathered figure who had appeared as if summoned by fate itself. Valdric's eyes found his, and a smile creased the ancient lawgiver's face.

"And you must be Thorac. I have not seen you since you were but a boy, yet I have followed your progression from afar, marking your achievements with pride. Your mother's blood runs true in you."

Orthox extended the scroll toward Valdric with reverent hands. "Then perhaps it is you who should open what your granddaughter left for us."

Valdric took the scroll, his fingers tracing the intricate seal with practiced expertise. "This is indeed Essa's work, and the binding... yes, only my hand was meant to break this." He reached into his traveling pouch and withdrew a small, ornate tool—its metal darkened with age and carved with symbols that seemed to shift in the firelight.

"Each lawgiver possesses one of these," he explained as he positioned the tool against the seal. "It serves not only to confirm the authenticity of the seal, but breaks it in such a way that it can later be verified that this tool, and only this tool, broke this seal—and that it was broken by me and only me."

With careful precision, he applied the tool to the wax. The seal parted with a sound like sighing wind, and the ancient parchment unfolded as if eager to finally reveal its secrets.

As Valdric read the words aloud, his voice took on the formal cadence of prophecy, each word carrying the weight of destiny finally fulfilled:

*"To my beloved son, should he live to read these words: You are not the end of something broken, but the beginning of something whole. In you flows the blood of both peoples, the hope of both clans. The laws that demanded your death will be transformed by your life. Know that your father's path will lead him to another touched by the weight of judgment, and from that union will come a sister born of different mothers but sharing your blood. Seek out this child of two worlds when the time comes, for together you will heal what our generation tore asunder. Two children of forbidden times, two bridges between worlds—in your joining of purpose, the clans will find their unity. The stone of ends beginning rests not in death, but in the courage to choose love over law, unity over division, hope over tradition. The gods have marked you both not for destruction, but for the greatest deed of all—the healing of wounds that have festered for generations. Be the bridge, my son. Find your sister. Together, be the answer to prayers not yet spoken."*

The four sat in stunned silence as the words settled over them like a benediction. Outside, the first light of dawn began to creep across the horizon, marking the end of the Clamortic Moon Cycle and the beginning of something entirely new.

Orthox looked at the exhausted lawgiver and grunted. "Valdric, you look worse than your horse. Sit yourself down before you fall over." He gestured to a chair by the fire, then began rummaging through his shelves, gruffly moving aside bottle after bottle of ale. Finally, from the farthest reaches of his cupboard, he withdrew an unopened bottle that bore special markings. "Gristation Ale," he announced with satisfaction.

Valdric's response was a hearty laugh that surprised the group with its vitality, echoing through the dwelling like thunder after a storm.
